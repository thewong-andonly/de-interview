# de-interview

A Solution I provided for a Data Engineer interview role.  All sites and general information about the target website have been removed in the event this question is reused.

Task:

Webscrape a website to create a ETL pipeline which is future proofed, flexible, and clean.

Features:

* Visits site
* Parses data
* Check for duplicate/existing values.  Only adds unique values to raw data
* Downloads raw data into a CSV
* Processes raw data and handles most edge cases
* Produces a metric report after it has finished running
